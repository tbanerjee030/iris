# Iris Simple Linear Regression
This project demonstrates how to perform simple linear regression on the Iris dataset using Python. Simple linear regression is a statistical method to model the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable. In this project, we use petal length as the independent variable and petal width as the dependent variable.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. Each sample consists of four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. For this project, we only use petal length and petal width.

## Tools/Libraries
- Python 3.x
